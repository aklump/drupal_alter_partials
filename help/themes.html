<ol>
<li>Create the folder <em>alter_partials</em> in your theme.</li>
<li>Enable <em>alter_partials_dev</em> and assign the block <em>Alter Partials suggestions</em> to a visible region in your active theme.</li>
<li>By enabling <em>alter_partials_dev</em> the caching of partials is disabled, you have access to a suggestion list of filenames as a block, and a partial stub writer is available, so this is very helpful during development.</li>
<li><strong><em>alter_partials_dev</em> MUST NOT BE ENABLED ON A PRODUCTION SITE.</strong></li>
<li>Visit the page you want to alter and find the filename suggestion that applies.</li>
<li>Create that file inside <em>alter_partials</em>.</li>
<li><p>Set the contents of the file to the following, and make sure the file is writeable by PHP.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
alter_partials_dev_stub(__FILE__, get_defined_vars());
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Visit the page and the file will be rewritten with a stub; reload the file to see the new contents.</p></li>
<li>The render array is called <code>$build</code>, which controls the output.</li>
<li>You now have an alter partial file; modify <code>$build</code> as desired.</li>
</ol>
